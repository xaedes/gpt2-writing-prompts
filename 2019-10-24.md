**The moon exploded in** vernal style;

At the time, it was as though the world had split apart;

Then an endless void spread out, filled with chaos.

The darkness swallowed the sky completely;

The wind blew like the rushing tide;

The moon, the sun and the stars could not be seen.

This moon, this space, had no name yet;

And no one could even describe it.

It appeared as though the universe was falling apart;

The stars shone white in the sun's brightness;

The water became dark and cold.

And from this darkness, endless void spread out.

Even the sun's light was extinguished.

But the moon's light remained, and bright light shone from it;

The sun's light shone, and the moon had no fear anymore.

The two were separated; the void expanded further.

There was no longer a border between them.

There was no longer a way to separate them.

But the one

**In the end there never was light. Before that there never was darkness.**
There was no sun. So, I ask, What then?
When I ask this question, I don't mean to trivialize the question itself.  I really 
mean it.  There is, in many respects, something almost spiritual about asking what 
was, or will be, before the light was shed.  Perhaps I should add, however, that I 
am not referring to the question in some abstract or metaphorical sense.  Yes, people
and other animal types, when they were human, did experience the light.  They 
experienced it to be so.  This was the whole point of the light.  Now, with that being
the case, when did the light shed itself?

The answer, of course, is that it was not until the day of the Light. It is a day that people will not see.  They will not see the light at all.  But, I ask, what was before the light was revealed?  What was its beginning?  And is the light the

It was no shadow. It was a ray of pure fire. It was a ray of pure light. And that very day, the light shone upon the face of man. And that is how the world was made.

**The crow, the sparrow and the duck meet each other at the beach.**
**Weird two legged wobbelings have left behind many snacks. The crow is especially keen to find some shiny things. Last summer she regulary scouted this area and hoarded a very lot.**
Her raven companion was quite happy on her flanks with a huge bag full of goodies.
A flock of pigeons are flying round the island. A few of the pigeons are attracted by the crow's snack. You'd never know from the way they move around. Just a little way to the west there is a very large flock and many are coming back to the same area in search of a bit of bird's feed. We're pretty sure some of them will take it for a snack but for the most part they are staying on the sand.
A bird has appeared in the sky. The bird is certainly big and very fast. The bird appears to be an orchard crow. It seems to be travelling through the island at very high speeds but has no idea where it is going or what is in the air.
